<h2> What is it?</h2>
<p> A program to automate making map files for the ir_remote app.</p>
<br>
<h2> Why should I use it?</h2>
<p>It helps people easily make map files even easier than copying/pasting.</p>
<br>
<h2>Where should I get started?</h2>
<p> Go to <a href="https://github.com/TGreenReaper/ir_remotemaker/releases/tag/app">Releases</a> and either download the exe, or clone this repo and use python.</p>
<h1> IS THIS A VIRUSSS</h1>
<p> First of all why would I make a virus and want to help people at the same time? It is not a virus and the source code which anyone can see proves it.</p>
<br>
<h1> How do I use this?</h1>
<p> Run either the .exe or .py file, it will prompt you with stuff you need to fill out. Once it is all done it will provide your created map file. It also is available in outputs/output.txt</p>
